I've ran into some installation problems with cteq6li.
Although it's correctly installed in the folder /usr/share/lhapdf/LHAPDF (I tried both installing through LHAPDF script and manually), I still receive the following error while trying to execute ./higgs .

PYTHIA Error in LHAPDF::LHAPDF: invalid pSet cteq6l1
PYTHIA Error in Pythia::init: could not set up PDF for beam A
PYTHIA Abort from Pythia::init: PDF initialization failed
PYTHIA Abort from Pythia::next: not properly initialized so cannot generate events

Doing last week assignment I also ran into installation problems and was unable to execute the fortran code for 7b.
I don't know if the two issues are connected, I'm currently investigating.
